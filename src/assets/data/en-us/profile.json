      "description": "My approach to problem-solving is characterized by adaptability and a 'never stop learning' mindset. I am not afraid to step out of my comfort zone to tackle challenges, as demonstrated when I moved from programming to the physical installation of network infrastructure and cameras in my first job. In my second job, hired for implementation, I quickly mastered the development of self-service kiosks, perfecting existing practices and achieving adaptability across various screens, which allowed me to lead projects with major brands. This ability to learn on the fly, as with SOA architecture, is fundamental to my methodology, always seeking effective and tangible solutions."
